    /// tree holding the scene is that the models use a local
    /// coordinate system for their vertexes and just state its
    /// origin in world coordinates. During rendering the coordinate
    /// system is translated to the origin of the model (glTranslate())
    /// and moved back after the models BSP tree has been traversed.
    /// Furthermore their are 4 indexes into node arrays. The first
    /// one has proofed to index the root node of the mini BSP tree
    /// used for rendering. The other three indexes could probably be
    /// used for collision detection, meaning they point into the
    /// clipnodes, but I am not sure about this. The meaning of the
    /// next value is also somehow unclear to me. Finally their are
    /// direct indexes into the faces array, not taking the redirecting
    /// by the marksurfaces.
