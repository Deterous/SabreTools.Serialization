    /// The MS-DOS EXE format, also known as MZ after its signature (the initials of Microsoft engineer Mark Zbykowski),
    /// was introduced with MS-DOS 2.0 (version 1.0 only sported the simple COM format). It is designed as a relocatable
    /// executable running under real mode. As such, only DOS and Windows 9x can use this format natively, but there are
    /// several free DOS emulators (e.g., DOSBox) that support it and that run under various operating systems (e.g.,
    /// Linux, Amiga, Windows NT, etc.). Although they can exist on their own, MZ executables are embedded in all NE, LE,
    /// and PE executables, usually as stubs so that when they are ran under DOS, they display a warning.
